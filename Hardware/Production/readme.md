 I suggest you to buy also the right angle pin I soldered on the RF modules. 
 I used [these](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/_XFCN-_C781823.html) for the 3-pin transmitter module (STX883s). 
 They have the standard pitch of 2.54 but they are thin enough to be inserted in the female connector on the board  **You have to buy at least 4 (2x2)** and then cut one. 
 
 For the receiver module (SRX883s), pins are [these](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/_HCTL-_C2905972.html). Also with these you have to cut one (I connected it to the board only with 5 pins out 6)

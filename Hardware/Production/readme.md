 I suggest you to buy also the right angle pin strips I soldered on the RF modules.
 
 - I used [these](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/_XFCN-_C781823.html) for the 3-pin transmitter module ([STX883Pro](https://www.nicerf.com/ask-modules/ask-transmitter-module-stx883pro.html)). 
 They have the standard pitch of 2.54 but they are thin enough to be inserted in the female connector on the board  **You have to buy at least 4 (2x2)** and then cut one. 
 
 - For the receiver module ([SRX883Pro](https://www.nicerf.com/ask-modules/ask-receiver-module-srx883pro.html)), pins are [these](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/_HCTL-_C2905972.html). Also with these you have to cut one (I connected it to the board only with 5 pins out 6)

Pay attention if you need the RF modules in 433MHz or 315MHz version. And then buy the spring antenna accordingly, like [these ones](https://www.lcsc.com/products/Antennas_912.html).

If you let the manufacturer assemble the board, remember to ask them to bend the IR leds to 45Â°, otherwise they will solder them straight.
